Description:

A really basic sinatra app to access your localhost redis instance by a restfull API.

=====================

This is a little toy I am working on.  This project is not complete at all, I am learning some interested concepts and I will experiment with them here.

I have started this project after reading this blog entry http://thechangelog.com/post/2910383164/webdis-a-redis-http-interface-with-json-output An awesome idea by the way!

=====================

Installation:

  - Install redis, you can do it from http://redis.io/
  - Install redis-rb with 'gem install redis' (more info at https://github.com/ezmobius/redis-rb)
  - Install sinatra with 'gem install sinatra' (more info at http://www.sinatrarb.com/)
  - Finally, clone this repository

Run baby, run:

  - To launch the server, you only need to write 'ruby -rubygems redis-rest.rb'

Testing it:

  - You only need to launch to your favourite web browser and go to http://localhost:4567/ping If you see a PONG, good for you!, everything is setup correctly.

Using it:

  - To use it you only need to introduce URLs like the folowings:
    - http://server:port/command[/key][/value]

  NOTE: Not all commands are supported at the moment.
